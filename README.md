# INT Host Reporter

## Deployment guide

### Create K8s secret 

We use private `registry.aetherproject.org` registry to pull the `int-host-reporter` image. To make the K8s deployment working
you firstly have to set up a K8s secret.

- Log in to `registry.aetherproject.org` using `docker login`. Your password will be stored unencrypted under `~/.docker/config.json`.
- base64 encode your password:

```
$ cat ~/.docker/config.json | base64 -w0
```

- Copy the output and create the `aether-secret.yaml` file.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: aetherregistrysecret
data:
  .dockerconfigjson: <base-64-encoded-json-here>
type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
```

- Create the K8s secret based on the `aether-secret.yaml` file.

`$ kubectl create -n kube-system -f aether-secret.yaml`

### Deploy INT Host Reporter



## TODOs 

- Only IPv4 is supported
- Currently, we generate an INT report for each packet. It might lead to the network overload. We may want to apply 
Bloom Filter or other solution to limit the number of INT reports.
